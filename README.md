This project was originally developed to help a friend easily make modifications to Mario Party. Unfortunately, the server associated with this project has taken a disturbing shift toward a bigoted, right-leaning ideology that is openly hostile to transgender individuals. This is a deeply unethical stance that runs counter to the values of equality, respect, and inclusion that I hold dear. Trans rights are human rights, and the mistreatment of anyone based on their gender identity is unacceptable.

What makes this situation even more troubling is that, despite a significant outcry from the community regarding the harmful behavior and discriminatory attitudes, the server's leadership has failed to take any meaningful action to address the issue. Instead of supporting those who stood up against the injustice, the individuals who took a stand were demoted or silenced, while the people spreading bigotry were elevated and promoted. This kind of systemic discrimination is not just wrong; it is a betrayal of the communityâ€™s trust and a reinforcement of harmful, oppressive dynamics.

I do not condone or tolerate such behavior. By locking this repository, I am taking a firm stance against this injustice. This project will remain locked until the server's leadership addresses the issue and creates an inclusive and safe environment for all people, especially transgender and marginalized individuals. Everyone deserves the right to exist without fear of hatred or exclusion, and it is our duty to call out and act against these wrongs wherever we see them.
