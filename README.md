## Description
Introducing the Mario Party Toolkit, a cutting-edge software designed to transform your Mario Party sessions into a personalized adventure. Developed by a diverse team of talented creators, this toolkit offers unparalleled control over various aspects of your gameplay. Whether you wish to adjust coin gains, manage item RNGs, or customize minigame wins and item prices, the Mario Party Toolkit provides a robust set of features to tailor the game to your liking. With an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) crafted for ease of use, this toolkit ensures that your gaming experience is both fun and customizable.

## History and Incident
Initially released on GitHub in late 2022, the Mario Party Toolkit was created to assist a friend in modifying Mario Party games in a mode we co-created called Mario Party Mayhem. Unfortunately, the server associated with this project has recently shifted towards a troubling, bigoted, right-leaning ideology, including hostility towards transgender individuals. This unacceptable stance contradicts the core values of equality, respect, and inclusion.

Despite significant backlash from the community, the server's leadership has failed to address the harmful behavior. The server owner has not only supported these discriminatory actions but has actively facilitated the promotion of those perpetuating bigotry while silencing or demoting individuals who opposed such conduct. This systemic discrimination undermines the community's trust and reinforces oppressive dynamics.

## Planned Course of Action

In response to this distressing development, I have decided to lock the repository and step back from Mario Party Mayhem as a firm stance against this injustice. The Mario Party Toolkit project will remain inaccessible until the server's leadership takes meaningful action to foster an inclusive and safe environment for all individuals, particularly transgender and marginalized communities.

## The Future
Going forward, I am committed to continuing the development of the Mario Party Toolkit with a focus on community values and ethical principles. I will seek alternative platforms and collaborations that align with these values to ensure that this project can thrive in an environment that supports and respects everyone.

To anyone reading this who is associated with the problematic server, I want to be clear: while I do not support your actions or ideology, I am willing to consider feature requests or allow you to use the software provided you do not actively target or harm me or my community. Your respect for these boundaries is essential for any future interactions.

Your support and understanding are crucial as we work towards a more equitable and inclusive gaming community. Thank you for standing with us against discrimination and for upholding the principles of respect and equality.
